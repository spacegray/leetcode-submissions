# Plan:
* First create a map of the roman numerals and their values
* create a variable to hold the result
* create a variable to hold the previous value
* Then loop through the string from the end
* set a variable to the current value = map at s of i
* If the current value is less than the previous value, subtract it
* Otherwise add it
* Set the previous value to the current value in order to increment the result
* Return the result
